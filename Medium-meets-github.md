How it works
============

> This whole website is an editable editor, You can click on text and start typing.

By changing the URL you can open any file fromÂ [github.com](http://github.com)

Just replace the [github.com](http://github.com)Â part of the url with [qinab.com](http://qinab.com)

Example
-------

This file you are reading si actually here:

[https://github.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.md](https://github.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.md)

To edit it you would open this url you are now:

[https://qinab.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.md](https://qinab.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.html)

And here you are in the medium-like editor.

To commit changes
-----------------

Login with GitHub and click on the "Commit" button in the top right. Don't forget to add a commit message ðŸ˜‰

_PD: It helps to know what it is a recursive acronym: **Q**inabÂ **I**s **N**ot **A** **B**log_
