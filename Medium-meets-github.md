How it works
============

This whole website is an editable editor, You can click on text and start typing.

By changing the URL you can open any from in [github.com](http://github.com)

Just replace the 'github.com' part of the url with 'qinab.com'

Example:

For example, this file you are reading si actually here:

[https://github.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.html](https://github.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.html)

To edit it online:

[https://qinab.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.html](https://qinab.com/guerrerocarlos/blog/blob/master/Medium-meets-github.html)

And here you are in the medium-like editor.

To commit changes:

Login with GitHub and click on the "Commit" button in the top right. Don't forget to add a commit message.

PD: By the way, if you want to remember the name of this service easily, it helps to know what it is a recursive acronym:

[Qinab.com](http://Qinab.com) Is Not A Blog
